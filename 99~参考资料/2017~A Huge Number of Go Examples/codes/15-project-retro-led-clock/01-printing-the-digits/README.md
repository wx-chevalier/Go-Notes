# GOAL 1: Printing the Digits

## Challenge Steps

1. Define a new placeholder type

2. Create the digits from "zero" to "nine"

      You can use these characters for the clock:

      ```
      Digit character       : █
      Separator character   : ░
      ```

1. Put them into the "digits" array

2. Print the digits side-by-side

     1. Loop for all the lines in a digit

     2. Print each digit line by line

     3. Don't forget printing a space after each digit

     4. Don't forget printing a newline after each line

     EXAMPLE: Let's say you want to print 10.

```
      ██   ███ <--- Print a new line after printing a single line from
       █   █ █     all the digits.
       █   █ █
       █   █ █
      ███  ███
         ^^
         ||
         ++----> Add space between the digits
```
