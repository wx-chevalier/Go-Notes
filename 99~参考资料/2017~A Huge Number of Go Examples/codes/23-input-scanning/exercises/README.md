# Exercises

Let's exercise with the scanner and maps.

1. **[Uppercaser](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/23-input-scanning/exercises/01-uppercaser)**

  Use a scanner to convert the lines to uppercase, and print them.
   
2. **[Unique Words](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/23-input-scanning/exercises/02-unique-words)**

  Create a program that counts the unique words from an input stream.

3. **[Unique Words 2](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/23-input-scanning/exercises/03-unique-words-2)**

  Enhance the previous exercise: Before adding the words to your map, remove the punctuation characters and numbers from them.

4. **[Grep Clone](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/23-input-scanning/exercises/04-grep)**

  Create a grep clone. grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data for lines that match a specific pattern.

  Create a program that quits when a user types the same word twice.

6. **[Create the Log Parser program from scratch](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/23-input-scanning/exercises/06-log-parser)**

  You've watched the lecture. Now, try to create the same log parser program on your own. Do not look at the lecture, and the existing source code. The link contains the code where you need to start working on.
