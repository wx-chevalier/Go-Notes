## GOALS:

### ðŸ‘‰ [STEP #1 â€” Print the Digits](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/15-project-retro-led-clock/01-printing-the-digits/)
- [ ] Define a new placeholder type
- [ ] Create the digit arrays from 0 to 9
- [ ] Put them into the "digits" array
- [ ] Print them side-by-side

### ðŸ‘‰ [STEP #2 â€” Print the Clock](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/15-project-retro-led-clock/02-printing-the-clock/)
- [ ] Get the current time
- [ ] Create the clock array
- [ ] Print the clock
- [ ] Add the separators

### ðŸ‘‰ [STEP #3 â€” Animate the Clock](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/15-project-retro-led-clock/03-animating-the-clock/)
- [ ] Create an infinite loop to update the clock
- [ ] Update the clock every second
- [ ] Clear the screen before the infinite loop
- [ ] Move the cursor to the top-left corner of the screen before each
      step of the infinite loop

### ðŸ‘‰ [BONUS: STEP #4 â€” Blink the Clock](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/15-project-retro-led-clock/04-blinking-the-separators/)
- [ ] Blink the separators
