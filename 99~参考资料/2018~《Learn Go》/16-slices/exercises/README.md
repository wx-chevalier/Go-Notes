## Exercises Level V - Advanced Operations

Commonly used and more advanced operations are available to slices. Now, it's time to test yourself and fix some common problems.

★ WARNING ★
Please update your local copy of the prettyslice package for some examples to work. [Please find the intructions how to do so here](../README.md).

1. **[Practice Advanced Slice Operations](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/16-slices/exercises/22-adv-ops-practice)**

    Let's warm you up for the advanced slice operations, and reinforce your neurons.

2. **[Limit the backing array sharing](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/16-slices/exercises/23-limit-the-backing-array-sharing)**

    Your package needs to control the slices that it shares with the outside world.

3. **[Fix the Memory Leak](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/16-slices/exercises/24-fix-the-memory-leak)**

    A slice retrieved from a package causes a memory leak in your program. You need to fix it.

4. **[Add a newline after each sentence](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/16-slices/exercises/25-add-lines)**

    Use the power of the `copy()` function and add newlines into a new buffer from a string slice. This exercise is more tricky than you might think.

5. **[Print Daily Requests](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/16-slices/exercises/26-print-daily-requests)**

    Group the web request logs into a multi-dimensional slice. Allocate a slice with the exact size needed by doing some wizardary calculations. And lastly, pretty print the result.
