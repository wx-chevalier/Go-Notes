/*
Summary:

- Prefer to work directly with concrete types
  - Leads to a simple and easy to understand code
  - Abstractions (interfaces) can unnecessarily complicate your code

- Separating responsibilities is critical
  - Timestamp type can represent, store, and print a UNIX timestamp

- When a type anonymously embeds a type, it can use the methods of the embedded type as its own.
 - Timestamp embeds a time.Time
 - So you can call the methods of the time.Time through a timestamp value
