# A Huge Number of Go Examples, Exercises and Quizzes

Best way of learning is doing. Inside this repository, you will find thousands of Go examples, exercises and quizzes. I initially created this repository for my **[Go: Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-go-the-complete-bootcamp-course-golang/?referralCode=5CE6EB34E2B1EF4A7D37)**. Later on, I added a lot of exercises, and I wanted every programmer who is not yet enrolled in the course to learn for free as well. So here it is. Enjoy.

**Available in the following languages:**
* **[English](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo)**
* **[Spanish](translation/spanish)** _(WIP: Please Contribute)_
* **[Chinese](translation/chinese)** _(WIP: Please Contribute)_
