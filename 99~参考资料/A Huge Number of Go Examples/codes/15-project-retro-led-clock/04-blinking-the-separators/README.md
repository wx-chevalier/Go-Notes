# GOAL 4: Blinking the Separators

## Notes

* Note main.go file contains the solution of the previous step.
* "solution" folder contains the solution for this step.

## Challenge Steps

Separators should be visible once in every two seconds.

### Example:

* 1st second: They're invisible
* 2nd second: visible
* 3rd second: invisible
* 4th second: visible

### HINT

There are two ways to do this:

1. Manipulating the clock array directly (by adding/removing the separators)

2. Or: Deciding what placeholders to print when printing the clock
